    <div class="abc"><h1>School life </h1> <br><p>I went to Srijana Secondary School during my early school years, where I passed the Secondary Education Examination (SEE). In addition, I attended Srijana Secondary School for grades 7 through 10, where I studied and developed a solid foundation in a variety of subjects. I had previously started my schooling at Disneyland Academy and finished it at Happy Boarding School, where I established the foundation for my academic career. In addition to concentrating on academic performance during these learning opportunities, I also participated in extracurricular activities that shaped my overall growth.</p></div>
